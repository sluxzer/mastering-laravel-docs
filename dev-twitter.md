Weâ€™re planning to use omni-channel to reply direct messages and comments, and we need twitter API to integrate our direct messages and comment from twitter to omni-channel. 
Our plan is just to reply our customer who engage us from twitter and reply them from omni-channel.

Our omni-channel will only use retweet and direct messages, and our sole purpose is just to reply our client, on direct messages we will reply our customer and not trying to engage them because our omni-channel only can reply not to engage.

Our customers engage us from retweet or direct messages then We will display retweet and direct message from our customers on our omnichannel so we can reply them, our omni-channel purpose is just to reply.
